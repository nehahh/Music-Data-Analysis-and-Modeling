## Import Data & Packages

Imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.

## Clean Data

Removes duplicate entries to ensure each track is unique.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzes and visualizes data distributions and relationships between features to understand patterns.

## Clustering

Applies K-means clustering to group songs based on their features. Visualizes clusters to interpret results.

## Regression

Builds a linear regression model to predict song popularity. Evaluates model performance using mean squared error.

## Key Learnings

- **Data Cleaning:** Identified and removed duplicates to refine dataset.
- **EDA:** Discovered relationships and distributions in music features.
- **Clustering:** Grouped similar songs, providing insights into genre and feature similarities.
- **Regression:** Developed a model to predict song popularity, highlighting the need for further refinement.
