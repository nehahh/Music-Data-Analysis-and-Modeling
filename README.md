## Import Data & Packages

Imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.

## Clean Data

Removes duplicate entries to ensure each track is unique.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzes and visualizes data distributions and relationships between features to understand patterns.

## Clustering

Applies K-means clustering to group songs based on their features. Visualizes clusters to interpret results.

## Regression

Builds a linear regression model to predict song popularity. Evaluates model performance using mean squared error.

## Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** I learned how to find and remove duplicate entries to make the dataset more accurate.
- **EDA:** I explored the data to see how different features relate to each other and their distributions.
- **Clustering:** I used K-means to group songs based on their features, which helped me understand how songs are similar or different.
- **Regression:** I built a model to predict how popular a song might be, and found out that the model needs more work to improve its accuracy.
