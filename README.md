# Music Data Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates data analysis and modeling on a music dataset. The notebook includes steps for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, clustering, and regression.

## Table of Contents

1. [Import Data & Packages](#import-data--packages)
2. [Clean Data](#clean-data)
3. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratory-data-analysis)
4. [Clustering](#clustering)
5. [Regression](#regression)

## Import Data & Packages

The notebook starts by importing necessary packages and loading the dataset. The dataset is read from a CSV file and basic information is displayed.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

tracks = pd.read_csv('/content/sample_data/First Data Science Model/dataset.csv')
tracks.head()
```

## Clean Data

Data cleaning involves removing duplicates and resetting the dataset to ensure that each track is unique.

```python
data = tracks.groupby(['track_name', 'artists']).first().reset_index()
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes summarizing statistics and visualizing the data. The notebook features histograms and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.histplot(data_numeric, x='popularity')

plt.scatter('energy', 'acousticness', data=data_numeric, s=0.2)
plt.xlabel("Energy")
plt.ylabel("Acousticness")
```

## Clustering

K-means clustering is used to group songs into clusters based on their features. Data is scaled using MinMaxScaler before applying the clustering algorithm.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data_numeric)
data_scaled = pd.DataFrame(data_scaled, columns=data_numeric.columns)

k_means = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
k_means.fit(data_scaled)
clusters = k_means.predict(data_scaled)
```

Visualizations of the clusters are provided to analyze the results.

```python
sns.pairplot(to_plot, hue='cluster', corner=True)
```

## Regression

A linear regression model is trained to predict the popularity of songs based on their features. The performance of the model is evaluated using mean squared error.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

X = data_scaled.drop('popularity', axis=1)
y = data_scaled['popularity']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
```

## Results

The regression model performs poorly, with a mean squared error indicating that further improvements are needed.
